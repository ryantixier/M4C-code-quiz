NOTES FROM BEN...

user types a key and i need to check if its part of a random Word
if yes, display the char in the DOM
if no, char is not displayed

need to set up a timer and if the user guesses the entire word correctly in the time alloted i increase the score by 1 for wins, if the user guesses incorrectly increase the score for losses by 1

what data do i need to track in the app?

what data structures can i use?

what do i attempt to accomplish first?

how do i choose a random word? where are they stored?  array

var words = ["Indiana Jones", "Jaws", "Shrek"]   //how do i randomly choose a word

how do i check if the character is part of the random word?

how do i know what key the user pressed?  event listener - keydown

NOTES FROM JUSTIN...

Divide HTML into 3 sections
. Intro
. Quiz
. Scores 

2 HTML docs
. index.html
. highscores.html

Save timer aspect for last

Run tests for questions individually, as you go

Donâ€™t hard code questions into HTML
. Have an array of objects to keep track of questions/choices/answers

Var questions = [
{
Q
C
A
},
 
{
Q
C
A
},
]
