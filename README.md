## Usage

Click the "Start Quiz" button from the homepage to begin the quiz. Once clicked, the quiz will begin; a timer will start that represents your score, which decreases by one (1) for every second that passes. Your score/timer will also decrease by ten (10) points/seconds if you answer a question incorrectly. You automatically move to the next question upon answering a question, whether correctly or incorrectly.

If your score drops below 0, or if you make it through all of the questions (9 total), you will automatically be taken to a high-score form; you may input your initials in the form field. After submitting the form, you will be redirected to the high-scores page; previous quiz-takers who saved their scores to your local storage will be displayed on this page, in order of descending score. To return to the main quiz page, click the "return to main page" link located near the top of the page.
